Hey, I’m Prajwal, an 19-year-old student at OSSU. I’m passionate about making projects—though I have a habit of starting them, getting halfway through, and then moving on to the next big thing! I love experimenting with new ideas and tackling challenging tasks, especially when it comes to computers. I’m most active on Discord, so feel free to ping me there if you want to chat or collaborate. Check out my portfolio to see what I’ve been working on (and maybe left unfinished!).
