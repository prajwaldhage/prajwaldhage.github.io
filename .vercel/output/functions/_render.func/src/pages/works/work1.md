As a Web Development Intern, I gained practical experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building responsive websites. I also used Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, enhancing my ability to work in a team and manage code effectively. This internship reinforced my skills in front-end development and real-world project workflows.
